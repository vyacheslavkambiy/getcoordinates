# getcoordinates
**Python application for HAMK project to get coordinates from address** 

Geolocation Coordinates from Address
This Python script provides a simple way to retrieve latitude and longitude coordinates from a given postal address. It uses the Geopy library, specifically the Nominatim geocoder, to perform the geocoding. Geocoding is the process of converting a postal address to geographic coordinates.

Prerequisites: Before using this script, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need the Geopy library, which you can install via pip:
bash pip install geopy

Usage: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run the script:
bash python getcoordinates.py
Enter the postal address when prompted. 
For example: Enter your address: Koulukatu 2, Lahti, Finland
The script will attempt to retrieve the latitude and longitude coordinates for the provided address. If coordinates are found, they will be displayed. If not, you'll receive a "Coordinates not found" message.
